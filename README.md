Implemented comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering on a 250,000-record dataset, creating derived features like "Time of Day" and "Arrival Status" for enhanced analysis
Developed and evaluated 10+ machine learning models including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks, achieving 91% classification accuracy
Executed advanced feature selection using Random Forest Analysis, PCA, and SVD techniques to optimize model performance
Performed clustering analysis using K-Means and DBSCAN algorithms to identify 16 distinct travel patterns
Applied association rule mining using Apriori algorithm to uncover relationships between delay patterns and time-based variables
Created interactive visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze delay patterns across different train lines and time periods
